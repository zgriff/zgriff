Hi friend! I’m Zach (@zgriff here, @zgruff on pretty much all other socials)
- I’m interested in all things video games, grew up as a Nintendo boy but have since expanded my horizons
- I’m currently teaching myself game dev in both Unity and Unreal, having worked previously in the Cornell game engine known as CUGL (which was built on top of SDL, code written in C++). For more information on CUGL, see here: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4152/2021sp/resources/engine/
- If you want to reach me, my email is zach@griff.games
